We read texts that explore trauma in some form or fashion and also produce writing that explores trauma. Over the course of the semester, we try to answer several questions by engaging in the practice of writing trauma. How do we convey the realities of trauma and its aftermath without being exploitative? How do we write trauma without traumatizing the reader? How do we write trauma without re-traumatizing ourselves when we write from personal experience? How do we write trauma without cannibalizing ourselves or the experiences of others? How do we tell stories of trauma without allowing the trauma to become the whole of our narratives?

As critics have noted, there has been a renaissance regarding the work of James Baldwin since 1999, with scholarly publications devoted to his work, public tributes, films, and publications of previously uncollected or out of print works. Critics had hailed Baldwin’s earlier works—Go Tell It on the Mountain, Giovanni’s Room, Notes of a Native Son—as his greatest literary accomplishments. After Baldwin’s most celebrated work—The Fire Next Time—Baldwin appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1963, under the heading “Birmingham and Beyond: The Negro’s Push for Equality.” In this moment, Baldwin became a celebrated public figure in the U.S. and beyond. Our class investigates the period after this height of celebrity, when critics lambasted him for being too political, too angry, too bitter, and losing narrative control and rigor. This two-decade span is significant because Baldwin was witness to the deaths and incarceration of Civil Rights leaders (whom he mourned as friends), the increased surveillance and incarceration of black activists, the Vietnam war, the emergence of Black Power, feminist movements, and gay and queer liberations. During this time, Baldwin lived primarily in Turkey and France, and continued to travel globally. Baldwin’s essays, novels, speeches, and poetry wrestled with how to formally capture and witness the violences of imperialism, homophobia, and racism. Since his death, Baldwin’s work has continued to influence and inform theoretical insights in American studies, literary studies, Black studies, and queer studies. Our class engages with Baldwin’s formal practices, political contexts, and critical interpretations across these fields. ","professors":["Leah Mirakhor"],"timesbyday":{"Thursday":[{"starthour":13,"startmin":30,"endhour":15,"endmin":20,"location":"WLH 209"}]}},{"subject":"AFAM","number":"358","section":"1","long_title":"Ethnography of Policing and Race","description":"Ethnography is the systematic study of culture and a method of knowledge production utilized by social scientists to apprehend, comprehend, and represent cultural groups and other social phenomena.

It is designed to allow graduate students to develop better fluency in psychoanalytic vernaculars, frameworks, and large-scale theories in order to gain a deeper and more nuanced appreciation of the persistence of psychoanalytic ways of thinking in the broader critical tradition in the humanities. Importantly, this is not a seminar dedicated solely to the psychoanalytic tradition; rather, it introduces students to seminal works by some of the major thinkers of early twentieth-century psychoanalytic thought in order to build a basis from which to understand the impact of psychoanalysis on the development of later twentieth-century critical movements, including woman-of-color feminist theory, queer theory, postcolonial studies, and black studies. In other words, the course provides a graduate-level introduction to the intellectual history and critical aftermath of psychoanalysis as a field of thought. It pays special attention to understanding psychoanalytic theories of the self, the subject, and the abject (among others), and putting these modes of conceptualizing the subject into conversation with both contemporaneous and later theories of subjectivity (materialist, Foucauldian, etc.).

Observing how Trump has exploited the populist resonance of white Christian American identity, we are watching a fierce battle over what constitutes “American-ness”—with conflicting ideas about religious identities, pluralism, and secularism at deep odds. This course surveys the role of religion in historical debates about American national identity, landing on our primary focus—the trope of the Muslim “other” as it permeates American popular, religious, and political discourse. In this course, you encounter and grapple with the deep history of American interest in the “Muslim world,” with attention to the role that Islam and Muslims play in constituting particular versions of American national identity. The course asks you to consider the juxtaposition of the categories “Islam” and “America,” and especially how these categories are mutually constructed. We also analyze how the category of “Islam” activates certain modes of American nationalism, particularly latent forms of Christian American nationalism that have long genealogies in American history. The course broadly surveys the sources of American discourse on Islam, including in historical and contemporary context. We pay attention to the processes by which certain discourses come to dominate and other are marginalized. You become familiar with relevant disciplinary tools to understand and interpret American political and religious cultures across time and space, drawing from sociology, anthropology, history, and political science.","professors":["Jonathan Wyrtzen","Roger Baumann"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":11,"endmin":15,"location":"LC 206"}]}},{"subject":"AMST","number":"388","section":"1","long_title":"James Baldwin 1964-1987: Transnationalism, Exile & Intimacy","description":"The course explores Baldwin’s oeuvre since 1964 until his death in 1987. As critics have noted, there has been a renaissance regarding the work of James Baldwin since 1999, with scholarly publications devoted to his work, public tributes, films, and publications of previously uncollected or out of print works. Critics had hailed Baldwin’s earlier works—Go Tell It on the Mountain, Giovanni’s Room, Notes of a Native Son—as his greatest literary accomplishments. After Baldwin’s most celebrated work—The Fire Next Time—Baldwin appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1963, under the heading “Birmingham and Beyond: The Negro’s Push for Equality.” In this moment, Baldwin became a celebrated public figure in the U.S. and beyond. Our class investigates the period after this height of celebrity, when critics lambasted him for being too political, too angry, too bitter, and losing narrative control and rigor. This two-decade span is significant because Baldwin was witness to the deaths and incarceration of Civil Rights leaders (whom he mourned as friends), the increased surveillance and incarceration of black activists, the Vietnam war, the emergence of Black Power, feminist movements, and gay and queer liberations. During this time, Baldwin lived primarily in Turkey and France, and continued to travel globally. Baldwin’s essays, novels, speeches, and poetry wrestled with how to formally capture and witness the violences of imperialism, homophobia, and racism. Since his death, Baldwin’s work has continued to influence and inform theoretical insights in American studies, literary studies, Black studies, and queer studies. Our class engages with Baldwin’s formal practices, political contexts, and critical interpretations across these fields. ","professors":["Leah Mirakhor"],"timesbyday":{"Thursday":[{"starthour":13,"startmin":30,"endhour":15,"endmin":20,"location":"WLH 209"}]}},{"subject":"AMST","number":"398","section":"1","long_title":"American Indian Law and Policy","description":"Survey of the origins, history, and legacies of federal Indian law and policy during two hundred years of United States history.

Importantly, this is not a seminar dedicated solely to the psychoanalytic tradition; rather, it introduces students to seminal works by some of the major thinkers of early twentieth-century psychoanalytic thought in order to build a basis from which to understand the impact of psychoanalysis on the development of later twentieth-century critical movements, including woman-of-color feminist theory, queer theory, postcolonial studies, and black studies. In other words, the course provides a graduate-level introduction to the intellectual history and critical aftermath of psychoanalysis as a field of thought. It pays special attention to understanding psychoanalytic theories of the self, the subject, and the abject (among others), and putting these modes of conceptualizing the subject into conversation with both contemporaneous and later theories of subjectivity (materialist, Foucauldian, etc.). Readings include works by Freud, Klein, Winnicott, Lacan, Jean Laplanche, Frantz Fanon, Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Judith Butler, Kaja Silverman, Hortense Spillers, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Lee Edelman, Leo Bersani, Elizabeth Grosz, and others.

The period between these two moments is also that in which the modern language of the environment took shape, from Cuvier’s discovery of extinction and Humboldt’s holistic earth science to the transformative work of Thoreau and George P. Marsh. This course shuttles between the contemporary debate about the significance and consequences of the Anthropocene and a reexamination of that environmental legacy. We look at the complexity of “nature,” beginning with the Bartrams, Jefferson, Cuvier, and the transatlantic literatures of natural history; georgics and other genres of nature writing; natural theology; ambiguities of pastoral in American romantic writing (Bryant, mainly); the impact of Humboldt (Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman); westward expansion and Native American writing about land; Hudson School painting and landscape architecture. We also think about the country/city polarity and the development of “grid” consciousness in places like New York City. One aim is to assess the formation and legacy of key ideas in environmentalism, some of which may now be a hindrance as much as a foundation. Secondary readings from Leo Marx, Henry Nash Smith, and William Cronon, as well as more recent attempts to reconceive environmental history (Joachim Radkau), ecocriticism (Lawrence Buell), and related fields, as well as science journalism (Elizabeth Kolbert).

Emphasizing ethnography’s concern with everyday life, practices, routines, and relationships, it analyzes how micro-processes and manifestations of race, sexuality, class, and gender entwine with macro-processes of empire and nation-state building, globalization, neoliberalism, transnationalism, urbanism, and social inequality in the United States, Latin America, and parts of the Caribbean. While this is not a “how to” course on ethnographic research, we use classic and contemporary ethnography to understand the region and gain greater knowledge about the process, epistemology, and politics of fieldwork. We analyze a number of aspects and approaches to doing and writing ethnography, including the challenges of entering, being in, and leaving the field; and as we build familiarity with the components of ethnography, we consider its applicability to an array of topics, settings, objects, cultural dynamics, and relationships. ","professors":["Ana Ramos-Zayas"],"timesbyday":{"Wednesday":[{"starthour":13,"startmin":30,"endhour":15,"endmin":20,"location":"WLH 004"}]}},{"subject":"AMST","number":"911","section":"1","long_title":"Working Group on Latina/o Studies II","description":"A continuous workshop for graduate students in American Studies, History, African American Studies, and related fields.

This upper-level seminar considers, from an ethnographic perspective, how gender has become a site of explicit politicization and contestation in post-Soviet societies. The first half of the course examines the changing circumstances of women and men in the post-Soviet economy following the Soviet collapse; the post-Soviet crises and reformulations of femininity and masculinity, and the social effects provoked thereby, such as violence, homophobia and new activism. The second half of the course examines the various 'intersections' of gender with other domains of social difference including class, age, race, religion, nationality. How gender is problematized in certain sites, workplaces, the home, and family is a topic of discussion, as is how certain ways of inhabiting gendered norms might give rise to forms of self and person, to modes of agency and freedom. Each post-Soviet case study is juxtaposed with comparative ethnographic examples in order to discern whether the post-Soviet region has its own gender dynamic, or instead partakes in broader global trends.

From solar power in Puerto Rico, to biometric ID cards believed to efficiently deliver welfare, to new cookstoves in India that promise to help women, how is technology imagined to furthering the project of ‘development’ that is often seen as synonymous with progress and economic growth? This course surveys a wide range of perspectives, histories, and dilemmas with the goal of understanding how to think of ‘development’ and ‘technology for development’ as subjects of study. We examine the gendered targets of development projects, as well as those who create and imagine these projects. We are especially interested in examining relations between development and economy, development and politics, development and technology. In addition to examining gender (often understood to mean just women) as a key aspect of development, this course uses a critical feminist lens to explore a range of issues, including discourses and practices of development within struggles over power, history and culture, the relation between development projects of today in relation to colonial projects and ideologies of ‘improvement’ and ‘the civilizing mission’ that were built on particularly racialized, sexualized, and gendered ideas. We also consider how the issue of gender and development has changed over time to include questions of gay rights, disability, and protections for children. In this way, we explore how ‘macro’ agendas have shaped the lives of millions of men and women living across the globe.","professors":["Deepti Chatti","Inderpal Grewal"],"timesbyday":{"Wednesday":[{"starthour":15,"startmin":30,"endhour":17,"endmin":20,"location":"CO493 103"}]}},{"subject":"ANTH","number":"371","section":"1","long_title":"Modern Indonesia","description":"Political and cultural dynamics in contemporary Indonesia explored from historical and anthropological perspectives.

In Russia, both political protest and political reaction are played out in overtly gendered terms (from Pussy Riot’s punk prayer to Putin’s bare-chested machismo). This seminar considers, from an ethnographic perspective, how gender has become a site of explicit politicization and contestation in post-Soviet societies. The first half of the course examines the changing circumstances of women and men in the post-Soviet economy; the post-Soviet crises and reformulations of femininity and masculinity; and the social effects provoked thereby, such as violence, homophobia, and new activism. The second half examines the various intersections of gender with other domains of social difference including class, age, race, religion, nationality. How gender is problematized in certain sites, workplaces, the home, and family is a topic of discussion, as is how certain ways of inhabiting gendered norms might give rise to forms of self and person, to modes of agency and freedom. Each post-Soviet case study is juxtaposed with comparative ethnographic examples in order to discern whether the post-Soviet region has its own gender dynamic, or instead partakes in broader global trends. These ethnographic cases are read alongside texts in feminist, gender, queer, and postcolonial theory to think across empirical examples in creative ways.","professors":["Dominic Martin"],"timesbyday":{"Tuesday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":11,"endmin":15,"location":"MY 601"}]}},{"subject":"ANTH","number":"755","section":"1","long_title":"Inca Culture and Society","description":"The history and organization of the Inca empire and its impact on the nations and cultures conquered by it.

Emphasizing ethnography’s concern with everyday life, practices, routines, and relationships, it analyzes how micro-processes and manifestations of race, sexuality, class, and gender entwine with macro-processes of empire and nation-state building, globalization, neoliberalism, transnationalism, urbanism, and social inequality in the United States, Latin America, and parts of the Caribbean. While this is not a “how to” course on ethnographic research, we use classic and contemporary ethnography to understand the region and gain greater knowledge about the process, epistemology, and politics of fieldwork. We analyze a number of aspects and approaches to doing and writing ethnography, including the challenges of entering, being in, and leaving the field; and as we build familiarity with the components of ethnography, we consider its applicability to an array of topics, settings, objects, cultural dynamics, and relationships. ","professors":["Ana Ramos-Zayas"],"timesbyday":{"Wednesday":[{"starthour":13,"startmin":30,"endhour":15,"endmin":20,"location":"WLH 004"}]}},{"subject":"ANTH","number":"864","section":"1","long_title":"Human Osteology","description":"A lecture and laboratory course focusing on the characteristics of the human skeleton and its use in studies of functional morphology, paleodemography, and paleopathology.

MANY is an online platform that facilitates migration through an exchange of needs. The project was initiated at Yale in 2017, and a small cohort of faculty and students exhibited a beta version of the platform at the US Pavilion of the 2018 Venice Architecture Biennale. See: http://dimensionsofcitizenship.org/participants/keller-easterling-with-many. MANY allows cities to match their needs with the needs of mobile people to generate mutual benefits. Using secure group-to-group connections and existing short-term project-based visas, cities can bargain with their underexploited spaces to attract a changing influx of talent—talent that offers time and training in exchange for global credentials. MANY speaks for those who want to resettle as well as for those who never wanted the citizenship that the nation withholds or reluctantly bestows. The seminar offers lectures and readings by thinkers, authors, strategists, developers, film makers, policy-makers, activists and urbanists from Yale faculty and outside guests together with workshops and one final presentation/symposium. Teams of students develop the project, exploring such things as Digital Architecture and Financing, Laws/Standards/Visas, Architecture/Urbanism/Landscape, Political/Economic/Environmental Migration, and Cultural Narratives of migration.

Students learn the software, together with the principles of designing and spacing type. Fully fledged type designers are not made in one term; the object is to “demystify” the subject and teach users of type an increased appreciation of it. Students work on individual projects, chosen in consultation with the instructors. Individual projects should be carefully chosen, so that the availability of the student’s new font makes a real contribution and serves a clear purpose. With the problems of type design so deeply interconnected, a clearly defined project is necessary to establish solid criteria for subsequent work.

The trajectory begins at the moment portable cameras and recording decks were introduced to the consumer market in the late 1960s. With moving images and audio data, video’s capacity to be seen “live” as an event was actually being recorded and its sense of immediacy and relative accessibility made it attractive to artists more interested in concept and process than in object making and marketability. Video and media art have exerted a powerful influence on the practices of all artists since the sixties. In the nascent years of video art, the only format available was videotape, and television monitors were the only means of display. Subsequently, wall-filling (and room-filling) video projectors became affordable in the 1980s. The introduction of new formats of production created a generation of work with increasing possibilities for expression and experimentation. The broader availability of other new technologies such as computer graphics, computer animation, interactivity, robotics, biotechnologies, and the infinite possibilities of communication through the Internet, heralded the transformation of video art into media art. This course is an eyewitness account of these transformations to the present day.

Against the backdrop of debates about what we lose from studying classics in translation, this course is alert to what traditional philology gains from that study and from theorizing the activity of translation.","professors":["Emily Greenwood"],"timesbyday":{"Tuesday":[{"starthour":19,"startmin":0,"endhour":20,"endmin":50,"location":"PH 312"}]}},{"subject":"CLSS","number":"892","section":"1","long_title":"Narrative and Vision","description":"This seminar explores the theory and practice of image production (enargeia, descriptio: the production of a full visual presence through verbal means) in ancient epic, with special focus on the narratological ends to which the poet’s special “visualizing effects” are the means.

We look at the related topics of ekphrasis, Roman concepts of “nobility” and “spectacle,” and to further developments in the production of visualization in the epics of Ovid, Statius, Lucan, and Valerius Flaccus, as well as to the basic practices, categories, and theorizations of film narratology (Bordwell, Mulvey, Verstraten).","professors":["Kirk Freudenburg"],"timesbyday":{"Tuesday":[{"starthour":14,"startmin":30,"endhour":16,"endmin":20,"location":"BM 013"}]}},{"subject":"CLSS","number":"897","section":"1","long_title":"History of Greek Literature II","description":"A continuation of CLSS 896a.","professors":["Emily Greenwood"],"timesbyday":{"Tuesday":[{"starthour":11,"startmin":35,"endhour":12,"endmin":50,"location":"PH 401"}],"Thursday":[{"starthour":11,"startmin":35,"endhour":12,"endmin":50,"location":"PH 401"}]}},{"subject":"CPLT","number":"554","section":"2","long_title":"Novel Minds: The Representation of Consciousness from Austen to Woolf","description":"Close study of selected novels by Jane Austen, George Eliot, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf, with particular attention to the representation of consciousness and the development of the free indirect style.

The social and legal notion of a “person” in modernity has been deeply informed by how “persons” are formed and performed on stage and in narration, and vice versa. Readings focus on two areas: (1) basic texts on the history of the notion of “person” and “character” in legal, poetical, and philosophical contexts from Hobbes to contemporary debates in environmental law; (2) the performance of personhood on the stage and the narrative evocation of a new modern character in the rise of the modern novel. Gender, race, and social class are of relevance throughout, as well as the question of being a nonperson (a witch, a monster, an outcast). With the opening cases of Shakespeare’s Tempest and Goethe’s Werther, we discuss what it means to appear as a person on stage and as a character in a novel. We pursue the discussion into modernity with modernist and contemporary narratives and how they test the limits and conditions of individual personhood (Woolf, Kafka, Handke, Sebald).

They hosted encounters with Western empires and witnessed the rise of new forms of participatory politics; they not only reflected the broader efforts of their respective nation-states to modernize and industrialize, but also produced violent reactions against state regimes. They served as nodes in networks of migrants, commerce, and culture that grew more extensive in the modern era. In these ways, the history of East Asian urbanism is the history of the fluidity and dynamism of urban society and politics in the context of an increasingly interconnected modern world. We study cosmopolitan cities across East Asia from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the present day. A comparative approach allows us to explore both general trends and themes, and distinct historical experiences across the countries of the region. Specific seminar topics include: urban politics, including state-society relations; cities as sites of geopolitical and imperial encounters; changes in urban society, including the impact of migration and social conflict; the urban environment, including natural and man-made disasters; urban planning, at the local, national and transnational scale; and ways of visualizing the city.","professors":["Michael Thornton"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":15,"startmin":30,"endhour":17,"endmin":20,"location":"SML 218"}]}},{"subject":"EAST","number":"407","section":"1","long_title":"The Political Economy of Reform in China","description":"This class seeks to explain how politics and the evolution of political institutions help explain the patterns and outcomes of major economic reforms in a single-party authoritarian state.

Such models have two building blocks: limits to arbitrage, which make it difficult for rational traders to undo the dislocations caused by less rational traders; and psychology, which catalogues the kinds of deviations from full rationality we might expect to see.

Most of the reading, however, will be in literary criticism and theory and in scholarly writing that makes use of literary methods. Topics include the power of narrative and of representation to create norms; the intersectional gender politics of language, including issues of access, code-switching, and appropriation; the uses of narrative as a scholarly tool and of narrative methods across disciplines; historicisms and presentisms; and art as activism.

In such depictions, trauma serves as pornography—a way of titillating the reader, a lazy way of creating narrative tension. We see trauma as it unfolds but are rarely given a broader understanding of that trauma or its aftermath. In this course, we explore what it means to write trauma ethically in fiction and creative nonfiction. We read texts that explore trauma in some form or fashion and also produce writing that explores trauma. Over the course of the semester, we try to answer several questions by engaging in the practice of writing trauma. How do we convey the realities of trauma and its aftermath without being exploitative? How do we write trauma without traumatizing the reader? How do we write trauma without re-traumatizing ourselves when we write from personal experience? How do we write trauma without cannibalizing ourselves or the experiences of others? How do we tell stories of trauma without allowing the trauma to become the whole of our narratives?

Sometimes the plays register this fact in fundamental encounters of characters and ideas and sometimes in the sheer ordinariness in the dialogue (for example, the reflexive “God b’wi’ you” in leave taking).

The period between these two moments is also that in which the modern language of the environment took shape, from Cuvier’s discovery of extinction and Humboldt’s holistic earth science to the transformative work of Thoreau and George P. Marsh. This course shuttles between the contemporary debate about the significance and consequences of the Anthropocene and a reexamination of that environmental legacy. We look at the complexity of “nature,” beginning with the Bartrams, Jefferson, Cuvier, and the transatlantic literatures of natural history; georgics and other genres of nature writing; natural theology; ambiguities of pastoral in American romantic writing (Bryant, mainly); the impact of Humboldt (Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman); westward expansion and Native American writing about land; Hudson School painting and landscape architecture. We also think about the country/city polarity and the development of “grid” consciousness in places like New York City. One aim is to assess the formation and legacy of key ideas in environmentalism, some of which may now be a hindrance as much as a foundation.

It is designed to allow graduate students to develop better fluency in psychoanalytic vernaculars, frameworks, and large-scale theories in order to gain a deeper and more nuanced appreciation of the persistence of psychoanalytic ways of thinking in the broader critical tradition in the humanities. Importantly, this is not a seminar dedicated solely to the psychoanalytic tradition; rather, it introduces students to seminal works by some of the major thinkers of early twentieth-century psychoanalytic thought in order to build a basis from which to understand the impact of psychoanalysis on the development of later twentieth-century critical movements, including woman-of-color feminist theory, queer theory, postcolonial studies, and black studies. In other words, the course provides a graduate-level introduction to the intellectual history and critical aftermath of psychoanalysis as a field of thought. It pays special attention to understanding psychoanalytic theories of the self, the subject, and the abject (among others), and putting these modes of conceptualizing the subject into conversation with both contemporaneous and later theories of subjectivity (materialist, Foucauldian, etc.).

As critics have noted, there has been a renaissance regarding the work of James Baldwin since 1999, with scholarly publications devoted to his work, public tributes, films, and publications of previously uncollected or out of print works. Critics had hailed Baldwin’s earlier works—Go Tell It on the Mountain, Giovanni’s Room, Notes of a Native Son—as his greatest literary accomplishments. After Baldwin’s most celebrated work—The Fire Next Time—Baldwin appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1963, under the heading “Birmingham and Beyond: The Negro’s Push for Equality.” In this moment, Baldwin became a celebrated public figure in the U.S. and beyond. Our class investigates the period after this height of celebrity, when critics lambasted him for being too political, too angry, too bitter, and losing narrative control and rigor. This two-decade span is significant because Baldwin was witness to the deaths and incarceration of Civil Rights leaders (whom he mourned as friends), the increased surveillance and incarceration of black activists, the Vietnam war, the emergence of Black Power, feminist movements, and gay and queer liberations. During this time, Baldwin lived primarily in Turkey and France, and continued to travel globally. Baldwin’s essays, novels, speeches, and poetry wrestled with how to formally capture and witness the violences of imperialism, homophobia, and racism. Since his death, Baldwin’s work has continued to influence and inform theoretical insights in American studies, literary studies, Black studies, and queer studies. Our class engages with Baldwin’s formal practices, political contexts, and critical interpretations across these fields. ","professors":["Leah Mirakhor"],"timesbyday":{"Thursday":[{"starthour":13,"startmin":30,"endhour":15,"endmin":20,"location":"WLH 209"}]}},{"subject":"ER&M","number":"340","section":"1","long_title":"Middle Eastern & North African Diasporic Narratives: The Memoir as History","description":"Our course examines memoirs alongside major historical and political movements in the Middle East and North Africa in the late 20th and 21st centuries.

One of our aims in this class is to understand the roles that scientific knowledge, practices, and values played (and continue to play) in these colonial processes. However, at the same time, Indigenous peoples have contested and resisted the claims made by colonial scientists and physicians, used science, medicine, and technology to express and extend their sovereignty, and consistently asserted the power and value of their own knowledge systems. Throughout the class, we discuss how these negotiations have taken show and consider how they can inform and complicate our sense of the relationship between science and indigeneity.

They hosted encounters with Western empires and witnessed the rise of new forms of participatory politics; they not only reflected the broader efforts of their respective nation-states to modernize and industrialize, but also produced violent reactions against state regimes. They served as nodes in networks of migrants, commerce, and culture that grew more extensive in the modern era. In these ways, the history of East Asian urbanism is the history of the fluidity and dynamism of urban society and politics in the context of an increasingly interconnected modern world. We study cosmopolitan cities across East Asia from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the present day. A comparative approach allows us to explore both general trends and themes, and distinct historical experiences across the countries of the region. Specific seminar topics include: urban politics, including state-society relations; cities as sites of geopolitical and imperial encounters; changes in urban society, including the impact of migration and social conflict; the urban environment, including natural and man-made disasters; urban planning, at the local, national and transnational scale; and ways of visualizing the city.","professors":["Michael Thornton"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":15,"startmin":30,"endhour":17,"endmin":20,"location":"SML 218"}]}},{"subject":"EVST","number":"415","section":"1","long_title":"Biotechnology and the Developing World","description":"Study of technological advances that have global health applications.

Instead, we seek to understand why norms change, and the lessons for environmental management. The class first turns to the humanities and social science disciplines, from political philosophy to religion and the environment, in order to unpack the ways in which norms emerge among humans that can’t be reduced to purely utility enhancing explanations. The class then turns to the disciplines of anthropology and sociology to better understand the role of cultural values and power dynamics in shaping how natural resources are valued, controlled, and protected. Finally, the class turns to political science, policy sciences, and institutional analysis to understand how, in the global era, environmental policies emerge and influence critical problems facing environmental managers.

Topics covered include, but are not limited to: evaluation of environmental policies (e.g., standards, taxes, cap-and-trade); cost-benefit analysis and its critiques; nonmarket valuation (ecosystem services, revealed and stated preferences); discounting and macroeconomic perspectives on climate change; management of nonrenewable resources (oil, minerals, etc.); management of renewable resources (forests, fisheries, etc.); land and biodiversity conservation; the relationship between development, trade, and the environment; strategic incentives for international environmental agreements; and environmental behavioral economics.","professors":["Matthew Kotchen"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":0,"endhour":10,"endmin":20,"location":"S 24"}],"Wednesday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":0,"endhour":10,"endmin":20,"location":"S 24"}]}},{"subject":"F&ES","number":"838","section":"1","long_title":"Environmental Product Life-Cycle Assessment","description":"Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is an analytical method that aims to quantify potential environmental impacts along the entire life cycle of a product, from extraction or harvest of natural, mineral, or fossil resources through production, distribution, and consumption, to final end-of-life disposal or reuse/recycling. LCA provides a quantitative evaluation of a wide range of environmental issues to avoid “burden shifting” between different life stages or different environmental concerns. Its primary applications include decision support in the context of design-for-environment programs and policy making as well as provision of a science-based basis for environmental claims used for marketing products in business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) settings. The course conveys the general principles and relevant definitions of the LCA methodology as defined in the ISO 14040 series of standards and exemplifies them through frequent reference to real-world case studies covering a wide array of industry sectors and product categories. The overall goal of the course is to provide the skills necessary to scope, manage, and scrutinize LCA studies in the business, consulting, or government sectors.","professors":[],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":16,"startmin":0,"endhour":17,"endmin":20,"location":"KRN G01"}],"Tuesday":[{"starthour":16,"startmin":0,"endhour":17,"endmin":20,"location":"KBT C27"}]}},{"subject":"F&ES","number":"857","section":"1","long_title":"Environmental History and Values","description":"This course provides an overview of major figures, ideas, and institutions in American environmentalism.

The beginnings of urban and park planning are considered in relation to these positions on the management of nature. Students survey the environmental movements from the 1960s onward in readings from the social sciences and humanities. The course explores the major debates in environmental ethics and the broader reach for global ethics.

Anthropologists are often assumed to focus on micro- or local-level research, and thus to have limited usefulness in the contemporary, global world of conservation and development policy. In fact, however, they have been examining global topics since at least the 1980s, and little current anthropological research is limited to the village level. More importantly, the anthropological perspective on the global economy is unique and important. This course examines the topics that make up this perspective, including using a single commodity to study the global economy, theorizing the transition to capitalism, the moral relation between economy and society, models for thinking about power in the global economy, articulations between rural households and the global economy, rural-urban relations in the global economy; the process of becoming a commodity, the commons debate, credit and debt, contracting and flexible accumulation, globalization and scale, and theorizing REDD. Readings for the course come from the subfields of environmental anthropology, economic anthropology, the anthropology of development, and the anthropology of conservation.

Approaching sustainability from a design perspective requires a fundamental conceptual shift from the current paradigms of product toward a more sustainable system, based on efficient and effective use of benign materials and energy. Through course assignments, class exercises, and a term-long team project, students are challenged with the same issues facing production and consumption systems today. The course is organized around the “engineering design process” from opportunity definition; criteria definition; ideation; alternatives assessment; and solution selection, implementation, and monitoring. To begin, the mega-trends driving sustainability discussions are presented and the case for new greener product systems is made. The course emphasizes quantitative and rigorous analysis of green design in addition to the tools needed to develop these designs. The foundational principles of the course can be summarized in the five I’s: (1) Innovation—we can’t solve problems at the same level of thinking used to create them, (2) Inherency—we can’t solve problems without looking at the nature of the system that created them, (3) Interdisciplinary—we can’t solve problems without looking at other aspects of the problem, (4) Integration—we can’t solve problems without connecting segments at a system level, and (5) International—we can’t solve problems without considering their context. The current approach to design, manufacturing, and end of life is discussed in the context of examples and case studies from various sectors, providing a basis for what and how to consider designing green products, processes, and systems. Fundamental engineering design topics include pollution prevention and source reduction, separations and disassembly, virtual and rapid prototyping, life-cycle design, management, and assessment.

Students will work in small teams taking on projects to address inequality and race discrimination in the distribution of health hazards as well as procedural inequities experienced by communities as they try to assert their own vision for the future of their neighborhoods, towns and cities. Students this past semester worked on projects that included: -Drafting federal legislation in consultation with community and advocacy groups across the country that would place a moratorium on concentrated animal feeding operations and enact other measures to limit their impacts; -Research and drafting public comments to be filed on behalf of environmental justice organizations regarding recently proposed changes to NEPA; -Research and analysis of the impacts of a landfill in a historically black community in Alabama analyzing landfill permit variances and assessing the relationship between race and landfill locations in Alabama. These projects will continue and in the coming semester, students will also have the opportunity to analyze the impact of Connecticut’s ten-year old environmental justice law and work with community groups in Beaumont, Texas and Uniontown, Alabama on the documentation of the impacts of polluting facilities such as refineries and landfills.

The course aims to think genealogically about the emergence and descent of large-scale urban screens as forms of public display and as new metropolitan interfaces. Today we are witnessing long-standing conceptions of the screen as a surface for the play of representations ceding ground to ecological understandings of the screen as an environmentally embedded node and as a point of dynamic mediation between actors and the world. Considering materials from film history, architectural history, art history, and urban history, the seminar considers the urban screen as a crucial part of the broader redefinition of the screen. Urban screens can be understood in terms of a rupture and recovery of screen history, wherein the fracturing of the screen (as movie screen) is coextensive with the recovery of older and alternate understandings of the screen (as facade, as protection, as shelter, as furniture, as filter, as masquerade, as control mechanism). A key aspect of the seminar is to work through the existing frameworks for thinking about urban screens and to propose new approaches that might shape this nascent area of study. In revisiting alternate histories of the screen, the course explores emerging screen cultures and their implications for the future of screen studies.

Although it has been understood for many years that trade can lead to winners and losers, the inequality effects of trade have typically been dismissed because they were thought to be small or unimportant. Recent evidence on the labor market effects of globalization has shown that increases in trade exposure can lead to substantial disruption in the labor market, which can last for decades and lead to persistent distributional effects. Since the benefits from trade are not equally shared, skepticism towards globalization has soared. This sentiment has led to a recent anti-globalization wave, with important political consequences. In this seminar, we discuss (i) the theory behind the labor market effects of trade, and, (ii) more importantly, what we know about how labor markets have responded to trade shocks, such as the emergence of China as a major international player, and trade liberalization episodes in developing countries over the past 30 years. The seminar is based on the discussion of recent academic papers on the topic, which is experiencing an explosion of interest and research.

This approach introduces measures of each of these dimensions in a way that links them to their conceptual foundations. In line with contemporary practice, discussion includes both money measures (income and expenditures) and multidimensional measures (such as education, health, and access to services).

To what degree was this trajectory inevitable, as new economic and geopolitical forces emerged after the Cold War? To what degree was it determined by choices made by the six most recent presidents, from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump? This seminar examines presidential decision-making over three decades, as these presidents and their advisers struggled to devise a new American “grand strategy” without the foil of a rival superpower. It explores how they defined U.S. national interests; what threats they identified pre- and post-9/11; and what diplomatic, military, and economic instruments of U.S. power they chose to meet those challenges. The primary objective is for students, especially aspiring policy makers, to develop an understanding of how complicated foreign policy making is in the heat of crisis, under competing strategic, political, and human pressures, and the president’s own instincts.

Classes are built around brief opening lectures; student discussions of framing questions from the instructor; the instructor’s insights from covering U.S. foreign policy making in Washington and conflict zones overseas; and occasional guest speakers directly involved in internal policy debates at the time.","professors":["Margaret Warner"],"timesbyday":{"Tuesday":[{"starthour":13,"startmin":30,"endhour":15,"endmin":20,"location":"AKW 100"}]}},{"subject":"GLBL","number":"612","section":"1","long_title":"Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship","description":"This is a practice-based course in which students from across campus form interdisciplinary teams to work on a social challenge of their choice. Teams include students from SOM, YSPH, F&ES, YDS, Jackson Institute, and other schools and programs. Students start by identifying a topic area of focus, then form teams based on shared interests and complementary skills. Over the course of thirteen weeks, student teams delve into understanding the challenge through root cause analysis and research on existing solutions and populations affected; then they apply human-centered design thinking and systems thinking to design, prototype, test, and iterate solutions. Using tools such as the theory of change, logframe, business canvas, and social marketing strategy, teams build and test their impact models, operational models, and revenue models. Readings and assignments from the textbook Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship guide this journey. These include technical templates, case studies, and interviews with social entrepreneurs and thought leaders in different sectors and geographies around the world. The class meets weekly for three hours in a workshop-style session; guests from local social enterprises join the class to share their experience, advice, and challenges. At the end of the term, student teams pitch their ventures to a panel of judges including social venture funders and social entrepreneurs. Teams are encouraged, but not required, to submit their ventures to one of the campus-wide start-up prizes. While there are no prerequisites, this course builds on the SOM core course Innovator (MGT 421), as well as electives including MGT 529, MGT 621, MGT 631, MGT 655, MGT 665, and MGT 867.

Through readings, discussions, role-play, writing exercises, and other tools, we learn how organizations succeed and sometimes fail in assisting individuals and nations in peril. We examine emerging regional hot spots, with an emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. We explore the challenges facing the governments, civil society organizations, and businesses in the aftermath of crises and the impact on citizens. We review the effectiveness of regional organizations like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and the African Union (AU) in assisting governments rebuild and stabilize their societies.

Although it has been understood for many years that trade can lead to winners and losers, the inequality effects of trade have typically been dismissed because they were thought to be small or unimportant. Recent evidence on the labor market effects of globalization has shown that increases in trade exposure can lead to substantial disruption in the labor market, which can last for decades and lead to persistent distributional effects. Since the benefits from trade are not equally shared, skepticism toward globalization has soared. This sentiment has led to a recent anti-globalization wave, with important political consequences. In this seminar, we discuss the theory behind the labor market effects of trade, and, more importantly, what we know about how labor markets have responded to trade shocks, such as the emergence of China as a major international player, and trade liberalization episodes in developing countries over the past thirty years. The seminar is based on discussion of recent academic papers on the topic, which is experiencing an explosion of interest and research. We make heavy use of microeconomics and econometrics.

Gender, race, and social class are of relevance throughout, as well as the question of being a nonperson (a witch, a monster, an outcast). With the opening cases of Shakespeare’s Tempest and Goethe’s Werther we discuss what it means to appear as a person on stage and as a character in a novel.

It examines the impact of these national/nationalist myths on revolutions and uprisings in the late Ottoman and post-Ottoman Middle East. The course readings, sources, and discussions examine the relationship between myths of national origin, revolution, and state-making. The class also addresses the ways in which the control over the creation of myths of origin and ethnic, racial, national, and religious identity shaped society and politics in nation-states, republics, and monarchies especially after 1918. The course focuses partly on the theoretical underpinnings of national myth-making and ideologies of nationalism in order to offer historical understandings as to how states, majority and minority groups, and different national movements in post-Ottoman society created and re-made ‘imagined communities’ of nationals and citizens, sometimes through violence. The course surveys the ways in which new identities became manifested in a number of often-revolutionary ideologies including pan-Arab nationalism, Zionism, Kemalism, Phoenicianism, Baathist socialism, and various anti-imperial and anti-colonial movements.","professors":["Lauren Banko"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":14,"startmin":30,"endhour":15,"endmin":45,"location":"YK212 004"}],"Wednesday":[{"starthour":14,"startmin":30,"endhour":15,"endmin":45,"location":"YK212 004"}]}},{"subject":"HIST","number":"089","section":"1","long_title":"Thinking about History","description":"An introduction to the discipline of history.

However, at the same time, Indigenous peoples have contested and resisted the claims made by colonial scientists and physicians, used science, medicine, and technology to express and extend their sovereignty, and consistently asserted the power and value of their own knowledge systems.

The first part examines the road to World War I and the course of the war in the Middle Eastern theater’s principle fronts (Caucasus, Mesopotamia, Sinai/Syria, North Africa, Dardanelles). We then look at the period immediately following the October 1918 Mudros Armistice (that technically ended Allied/Ottoman hostilities). During this violent “Wilsonian Moment” in the Middle East, local aspirations for self-determination were articulated, reformulated, and argued locally and internationally while colonial actors—British, French, Italian, and Spanish—mobilized competing state-building projects. The last section of the course looks at the climax points of conflict between these competing projects in the mid to late 1920s—including the Great Syrian Revolt, the Rif War, Kurdish Revolts, Saudi wars of consolidation, and the Italo-Sanusi war in Libya—and how present-day political units were finally negotiated.

They served as nodes in networks of migrants, commerce, and culture that grew more extensive in the modern era. In these ways, the history of East Asian urbanism is the history of the fluidity and dynamism of urban society and politics in the context of an increasingly interconnected modern world. We study cosmopolitan cities across East Asia from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the present day. A comparative approach allows us to explore both general trends and themes, and distinct historical experiences across the countries of the region.

Alfred Thayer Mahan of the Naval War College stated that, “One thing is sure. In the Caribbean Sea is the strategical key of two great oceans, the Atlantic and Pacific; our own maritime frontiers.” The Spanish-American War provided the opportunity for the United States to control the last two colonies of the Spanish empire in America, Cuba and Puerto Rico, both strategically located to protect the Eastern entrance of the newly built Panama Canal. Eventually, Cuba became independent but remained under U.S. control until the Cuban Revolution in 1959; Puerto Rico is still a territory of the United States. The Dominican Republic’s request for statehood in 1870, promoted by President Ulysses S. Grant, was rejected by Congress. From 1916 to 1924 the United States occupied and established a military government there and managed its customs revenues until 1940, collecting monies owed to U.S. investors. In 1965 the United States again invaded the Dominican Republic. In this course we discuss and evaluate the various U.S. policies in the Caribbean during the twentieth century: Theodore Roosevelt’s Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine and his “Big Stick Diplomacy,” Taft’s “Dollar Diplomacy,” FDR’s “Good Neighbor Policy,” and the “Strategy of Containment” during the Cold War. The Hispanic Caribbean represents 60 percent of the region’s population and, during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, was the epicenter for a potential World War III.","professors":["Angel Collado-Schwarz"],"timesbyday":{"Tuesday":[{"starthour":15,"startmin":30,"endhour":17,"endmin":20,"location":"LC 204"}]}},{"subject":"HIST","number":"818","section":"1","long_title":"Commodity Production and Environmental History in Latin America and the Caribbean","description":"This course presents readings across the past six centuries that examine the human impact on the environment of the region from a geographical and ecological perspective.

While our study concentrates primarily on art and textual sources from the premodern world, we also engage modern theoretical and scientific scholarship (much of which has come out of the “memory boom,” an explosion of interest in memory as a field of academic interest since the 1980s and 1990s) in our analyses and discussions. Thus the seminar not only considers fundamental questions concerning the workings of ancient and medieval memory, but also serves as an introduction to the methodologies and important works of scholarly literature that have shaped the wide-ranging field of memory studies. Topics include the relationship between the visual and the mnemonic; the changing role of the mnemonic from the early to later medieval period; pilgrimage and sites of memory; the performance of memory through song, homilies, and commemoration of the dead; memory and the passage of time. Readings are drawn from primary sources and a range of fields, including art history, cultural history, anthropology, sociology, and critical theory. What is the relationship of memory to the sense of sight? How is memory used in worship or in spiritual contemplation? How does memory disrupt and remake history? What is the role of forgetting in shaping historical consciousness? What is the relationship between personal and collective memory?

Divided between colore/couleur and colorito/coloris, and frequently opposed to disegno/dessin, color has often been relegated to second place and to the status of supplement, derogatorily associated with the superficial, the ephemeral, the deceptive, the illusory, the artificial, and the feminine. At the same time, it has been understood as the “difference” of painting, it is the essence of “what painting is” from a material and practical point of view, it has been at the heart of the paragone debates, and it has been a linchpin of modern and modernist art and theory. This course looks at the history of thought about color in a variety of areas: the alchemical and chemical; the practical and the theoretical; the science of optics; discourse, rhetoric, poetics, and philosophy. Writers addressed include Cennino Cennini and other authors of artist’s manuals; Roger de Piles, Sir Isaac Newton, and Johann Wolfgang van Goethe; Charles Baudelaire, Michel Eugène Chevreul, and Josef Albers; Rainer Maria Rilke and Ludwig Wittgenstein.

The course aims to think genealogically about the emergence and descent of large-scale urban screens as forms of public display and as new metropolitan interfaces. Today we are witnessing long-standing conceptions of the screen as a surface for the play of representations ceding ground to ecological understandings of the screen as an environmentally embedded node and as a point of dynamic mediation between actors and the world. Considering materials from film history, architectural history, art history, and urban history, the seminar considers the urban screen as a crucial part of the broader redefinition of the screen. Urban screens can be understood in terms of a rupture and recovery of screen history, wherein the fracturing of the screen (as movie screen) is coextensive with the recovery of older and alternate understandings of the screen (as facade, as protection, as shelter, as furniture, as filter, as masquerade, as control mechanism). A key aspect of the seminar is to work through the existing frameworks for thinking about urban screens and to propose new approaches that might shape this nascent area of study. In revisiting alternate histories of the screen, the course explores emerging screen cultures and their implications for the future of screen studies.

In-class periods consist of very interactive, didactic sections covering disease phenotype, underlying immunobiology and pathology, and mechanisms of treatment approaches, including limitations. Discussions are led by principal investigators who focus on human translational immunology and by clinician-scientists who see patients in associated clinics. Examples of topics include: T and B cell contributions to the underlying pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, and other autoimmune diseases; immune responses to acute brain injury; inherited immune disorders; paradigms governing how antitumor immune responses are promoted or suppressed; and current approaches in immunotherapy-based clinical trials. Assignments challenge students to think creatively about solutions to problems that obstruct the progress toward understanding disease mechanisms and developing therapeutics. A term assignment, in the form of a research proposal, focuses on independent study of a translational immunobiology problem of each student’s choosing. Students are provided with elective opportunities for experiential learning through clinic visits with course faculty instructors. The combination of medical knowledge and interaction with translational  and clinician-scientists provides a new perspective to immunobiology Ph.D. students that broadens their basic science training.

The existence of religious laws and their institutions is often accommodated and tolerated by the laws of the state, even as they challenge the ideal of the rule of secular law, with its notion of the superiority of that law. For this reason, in various fields whose practitioners are faced with the tension between the law of the modern state and traditional religious law, familiarity with the content and character of religious law can be a crucial asset. There are many ways to approach the study of foreign legal systems.

Among the subjects considered are the Jewish quarter and street; the synagogue; the ritual bath (mikve); the cemetery and gravestone; book culture; charters; jewelry; fashion; and food.","professors":["Micha Perry"],"timesbyday":{"Tuesday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":11,"endmin":15,"location":"BASSLB L71"}]}},{"subject":"KREN","number":"120","section":"1","long_title":"Elementary Korean II","description":"Continuation of KREN 110.\n\n1.5 Yale College course credits","professors":["Seungja Choi"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":10,"endmin":15,"location":"WTS A32"}],"Tuesday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":10,"endmin":15,"location":"WTS A32"}],"Wednesday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":10,"endmin":15,"location":"WTS A32"}],"Thursday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":10,"endmin":15,"location":"WTS A32"}],"Friday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":10,"endmin":15,"location":"WTS A32"}]}},{"subject":"KREN","number":"120","section":"2","long_title":"Elementary Korean II","description":"Continuation of KREN 110.\n\n1.5 Yale College course credits","professors":["Seungja Choi"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":10,"startmin":30,"endhour":11,"endmin":20,"location":"WTS A32"}],"Tuesday":[{"starthour":10,"startmin":30,"endhour":11,"endmin":20,"location":"WTS A32"}],"Wednesday":[{"starthour":10,"startmin":30,"endhour":11,"endmin":20,"location":"WTS A32"}],"Thursday":[{"starthour":10,"startmin":30,"endhour":11,"endmin":20,"location":"WTS A32"}],"Friday":[{"starthour":10,"startmin":30,"endhour":11,"endmin":20,"location":"WTS A32"}]}},{"subject":"KREN","number":"120","section":"3","long_title":"Elementary Korean II","description":"Continuation of KREN 110.\n\n1.5 Yale College course credits","professors":["Ho Eun Park"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":11,"startmin":35,"endhour":12,"endmin":25,"location":"WTS A32"}],"Tuesday":[{"starthour":11,"startmin":35,"endhour":12,"endmin":25,"location":"WTS A32"}],"Wednesday":[{"starthour":11,"startmin":35,"endhour":12,"endmin":25,"location":"WTS A32"}],"Thursday":[{"starthour":11,"startmin":35,"endhour":12,"endmin":25,"location":"WTS A32"}],"Friday":[{"starthour":11,"startmin":35,"endhour":12,"endmin":25,"location":"WTS A32"}]}},{"subject":"KREN","number":"140","section":"1","long_title":"Intermediate Korean II","description":"Continuation of KREN 130.\n\n1.5 Yale College course credits","professors":["Angela Lee-Smith"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":10,"endmin":15,"location":"CO493 106"}],"Tuesday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":10,"endmin":15,"location":"CO493 106"}],"Wednesday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":10,"endmin":15,"location":"CO493 106"}],"Thursday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":10,"endmin":15,"location":"CO493 106"}],"Friday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":10,"endmin":15,"location":"CO493 106"}]}},{"subject":"KREN","number":"142","section":"1","long_title":"Intermediate Korean for Advanced Learners II","description":"Continuation of KREN 132.\n\n1.5 Yale College course credits","professors":["Angela Lee-Smith"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":10,"startmin":30,"endhour":11,"endmin":20,"location":"CO493 106"}],"Tuesday":[{"starthour":10,"startmin":30,"endhour":11,"endmin":20,"location":"CO493 106"}],"Wednesday":[{"starthour":10,"startmin":30,"endhour":11,"endmin":20,"location":"CO493 106"}],"Thursday":[{"starthour":10,"startmin":30,"endhour":11,"endmin":20,"location":"CO493 106"}],"Friday":[{"starthour":10,"startmin":30,"endhour":11,"endmin":20,"location":"CO493 106"}]}},{"subject":"KREN","number":"154","section":"1","long_title":"Advanced Korean III","description":"An advanced language course designed to develop reading and writing skills using Web-based texts in a variety of genres.

We supplement our reading with occasional secondary sources that throw into relief the potentially different ways in which fact and fiction operated in the ancient world. Over the course of the term, we return to two central questions: 1) What is the relationship between truth and genre?  2) How did ancient audiences experience truth? In exploring these questions, we grapple with the function of truth in our own society, and reflect on the complex and often problematic legacy of truth as standard of writing.","professors":["Rachel Love"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":0,"endhour":10,"endmin":15,"location":"BM 013"}],"Wednesday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":0,"endhour":10,"endmin":15,"location":"BM 013"}]}},{"subject":"LATN","number":"439","section":"1","long_title":"Roman Satire","description":"Close reading of a large cross section of Roman verse satire, with attention to language, style, genre, and cultural context.

Among these were Averroes, Maimonides, and Aquinas. Their writings represent a supreme effort at philosophical synthesis. Whether the effort was successful -- or even could be -- is an open question. In this yearlong seminar, we will explore the question by first studying Aristotle in sufficient detail to orient ourselves in his thought. After that, in the first term, we will read selections from Avicenna, Al Ghazali, and Averroes. In the second term, we will begin with Maimonides and go on to Aquinas.

The social and legal notion of a “person” in modernity has been deeply informed by how “persons” are formed and performed on stage and in narration, and vice versa. Readings focus on two areas: (1) basic texts on the history of the notion of “person” and “character” in legal, poetical, and philosophical contexts from Hobbes to contemporary debates in environmental law; (2) the performance of personhood on the stage and the narrative evocation of a new modern character in the rise of the modern novel. Gender, race, and social class are of relevance throughout, as well as the question of being a nonperson (a witch, a monster, an outcast). With the opening cases of Shakespeare’s Tempest and Goethe’s Werther we discuss what it means to appear as a person on stage and as a character in a novel. We pursue the discussion into modernity with modernist and contemporary narratives  and  how they test the limits and conditions of individual personhood (Woolf, Kafka, Handke, Sebald). We end with contemporary post-migrant theater (Jelinek, Ronen) and ecopoetics (Spahr).","professors":["Katrin Truestedt","Rudiger Campe"],"timesbyday":{"Wednesday":[{"starthour":15,"startmin":30,"endhour":17,"endmin":20,"location":"WLH 012"}]}},{"subject":"MATH","number":"108","section":"1","long_title":"Estimation and Error","description":"A problem-based investigation of basic mathematical principles and techniques that help make sense of the world.

A group G is stable if any almost homomorphism from G to another target group is close to an actual homomorphism, in a controlled way. There has been recent interest in studying stability, partially motivated by the relation to sofic groups. Namely, a stable, nonresidually finite group cannot be sofic: that is, it cannot be approximated in a certain very flexible way by finite groups. We discuss in detail a paper by Becker, Lubotzky, and Thom that gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of amenable groups. The condition is formulated in terms of invariant random subgroups, another novel notion in group theory that is studied in this course.

in the creation of nation-states in the post-Ottoman Middle East, including Iraq, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey, as well as in Iran and Egypt. It explores the ways in which national identities and nation-states formed—in ways both organic and forced—around certain myths and ideologies. It examines the impact of these national/nationalist myths on revolutions and uprisings in the late Ottoman and post-Ottoman Middle East. The course readings, sources, and discussions examine the relationship between myths of national origin, revolution, and state-making. The class also addresses the ways in which the control over the creation of myths of origin and ethnic, racial, national, and religious identity shaped society and politics in nation-states, republics, and monarchies especially after 1918. The course focuses partly on the theoretical underpinnings of national myth-making and ideologies of nationalism in order to offer historical understandings as to how states, majority and minority groups, and different national movements in post-Ottoman society created and re-made ‘imagined communities’ of nationals and citizens, sometimes through violence. The course surveys the ways in which new identities became manifested in a number of often-revolutionary ideologies including pan-Arab nationalism, Zionism, Kemalism, Phoenicianism, Baathist socialism, and various anti-imperial and anti-colonial movements.","professors":["Lauren Banko"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":14,"startmin":30,"endhour":15,"endmin":45,"location":"YK212 004"}],"Wednesday":[{"starthour":14,"startmin":30,"endhour":15,"endmin":45,"location":"YK212 004"}]}},{"subject":"MMES","number":"138","section":"1","long_title":"Introduction to the Quran","description":"Introduction to the study of the Quran.

This seminar examines what can be called the “Long Great War” in the Middle East. The first part examines the road to World War I and the course of the war in the Middle Eastern theater’s principle fronts (Caucasus, Mesopotamia, Sinai/Syria, North Africa, Dardanelles). We then look at the period immediately following the October 1918 Mudros Armistice (that technically ended Allied/Ottoman hostilities). During this violent “Wilsonian Moment” in the Middle East, local aspirations for self-determination were articulated, reformulated, and argued locally and internationally while colonial actors—British, French, Italian, and Spanish—mobilized competing state-building projects. The last section of the course looks at the climax points of conflict between these competing projects in the mid to late 1920s—including the Great Syrian Revolt, the Rif War, Kurdish Revolts, Saudi wars of consolidation, and the Italo-Sanusi war in Libya—and how present-day political units were finally negotiated. We conclude discussing how the Long Great War continues to echo and resonate in contemporary upheaval in the Middle East a century later.","professors":["Jonathan Wyrtzen"],"timesbyday":{"Wednesday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":11,"endmin":15,"location":"LC 105"}]}},{"subject":"MMES","number":"360","section":"1","long_title":"North African French Poetry","description":"Introduction to North African poetry composed in French during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

Importantly, the course problematizes the idea of ‘modernity’ in our historical understanding of the region. Using as a general framework the transition from empire to nation-state, it explores several key themes including discourses and practices of colonialism across the region, the creation of ethno-national, sectarian, and religious identities, social and political upheavals wrought by revolts, rebellions, and new state formations, the changing nature of economies and labor, the rise of authoritarian leadership, the ideological spread of Arab socialism, anti-colonialism, pan-Islamism, and other political and social byproducts and consequences of the creation of ‘modern’ states. Each week we cover the ways these themes impacted the wider Middle East and North Africa. The readings and lectures encourage students to critically examine the historical explanations, definitions, and arguments regarding the impact or the non-impact of modernity as the driving force for transformations and stagnations in society, culture, politics, and state-formation across the Middle East and North Africa.

Composers such as Josquin Desprez, Orlando di Lasso, and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina led the genre to its peak. In the seventeenth century, however, the genre underwent a transition. Modern genres like the concerto, monody, and solo song employed, on one hand, techniques that were developed in the motet (e.g., counterpoint), yet on the other hand, they claimed the place of the motet as the leading vocal genre in church music. The course outlines the history of the motet in the crucial time between its peak in the sixteenth century (starting with Josquin) and its transition (one might even say dissolution) into other genres in the seventeenth century (until Bach). The course combines a general overview with an in-depth study of selected composers. In addition to this analytical approach, the course looks at the religious context of this historical change of paradigm, as the transition from polyphonic music in the sixteenth century to soloistic genres in the seventeenth coincided with a change in piety around the turn of the century. Course requirements include participation in discussions, two or three short essays, a twenty-minute presentation, and a final paper of approximately fifteen pages.","professors":["Markus Rathey"],"timesbyday":{"Tuesday":[{"starthour":13,"startmin":30,"endhour":15,"endmin":20,"location":"PR406 203"}]}},{"subject":"MUS","number":"540","section":"4","long_title":"Indiv Instrctn--: Indiv Instrctn-- CHORAL COND","description":"4 credits per term.

This course in the analysis of contemporary repertoire focuses on helping students gain a thorough understanding of certain pieces written by living or recently deceased composers, ranging from Sofia Gubaidulina’s Feast during a Plague and Mauricio Kagel’s Les idées fixes and Musik für Renaissance-Instrumente, to selected piano pieces of Frederic Rzewski. The goal is to become flexible using analytical tools that are fluid enough to be sensitive to each work, in order to arrive at a deep and thorough understanding of each piece. It is impossible to use only one analytical method when considering contemporary music, because there is no common syntax among pieces that would allow for a descriptive theory. The course therefore presents various ways of analyzing non-tonal music. We talk about a range of tools, from a modified post-Schenkerian theory of linearity and directionality, to various strands of Neo-Riemannian theory as presented by David Lewin, Richard Cohn, and others. Recent work by Alexander Rehding is touched upon, and we visit selections from The Oxford Handbook of Neo-Riemannian Music Theories. We also read, among other analyses, Lewin’s Musical Form and Transformation. The main goal, however, is to develop our own ways of thinking about and understanding contemporary music. So while readings of existing analyses and methods for analysis prove useful in promoting fluency with critical and connective thinking, students are challenged to be adaptive in their methods to respond to specific contexts and syntaxes, which can change not only piece to piece, but within a single work.","professors":["Hannah Lash"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":10,"startmin":30,"endhour":12,"endmin":20,"location":"HEN 116"}]}},{"subject":"MUS","number":"594","section":"1","long_title":"Vocal Chamber Music","description":"1 credit.

NP. Group B. How are we to perform, today, music from the Baroque era (ca. 1600–1750)? The diverse styles of the instrumental and vocal music composed during this period elicit wide and quite differing responses from instrumentalists and singers attuned to pre-Classic and Romantic performance practices. In this course, which is centered on both performance and discussion, we take in the many possibilities available to the performer of music composed in this period. Topics include Baroque sound, ornamentation, vibrato, text-music relationships, improvisation, tempo and meter, rhythmic alteration, dynamics, pitch, tuning and temperament, and basso continuo. We compare period instruments to their modern counterparts, and we read and discuss primary and secondary source documents. Students learn how to approach modern editions critically and use primary sources to guide their performance-practice decisions. We explore detailed musical issues within larger historical and critical contexts—for example, the importance of national preferences (e.g., dance in France, rhetoric in Germany). At the same time, we look at the ideologies of the early music movement as it has taken shape in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The success of this class hinges in large part on the quality of student preparation and participation. Students should be prepared to perform often on their respective instruments; they will be coached on various aspects of Baroque works from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Small oral reports throughout the term on aspects of performance practice, as well as a larger oral presentation on a particular piece at the end of the term, are required.","professors":["Arthur Haas","Daniel Lee"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":11,"endmin":15,"location":"HEN 114"}]}},{"subject":"MUS","number":"631","section":"1","long_title":"Repertory Chorus—Voice","description":"2 credits per term.

We analyze how each opera unfolds dramatically and musically—attending, on the one hand, to the libretto and its source in Russian literature; and on the other, to the expressive import and formal structure of the music.

A historical thread is traced from medieval through contemporary graphic scores. We explore how and why sounds came to be written down and the spread of musical literacy; and we analyze the circumstances in which the visual presentation of music takes on its own distinct meaning. Parallels are drawn between the notational innovations of the late medieval and late modern periods—eras in which composers questioned the descriptive, prescriptive, and creative potential of musical inscriptions. To understand historical texts in their original milieu, we study the ways in which medieval chansonniers were created, read, revised, and safeguarded. The composers at the heart of our study include Baude Cordier, Senleches, Guillaume Du Fay, Binchois, Johannes Ockeghem, Antoine Busnoys, Caron, and Hayne van Ghizeghem. In a 1964 Darmstadt lecture, Earle Brown described “a curious feeling of returning to a musical condition which prevailed in times past.” John Cage and Cornelius Cardew were among those who shared Brown’s view that notation could be understood as “vocabulary and punctuation in an abstract language whose syntax is potentially infinite.” In the final weeks of the seminar, we consider Brown’s Folio, Cage’s Song Books, and Cardew’s Treatise as representative exemplars of the continuation of a long notational journey. Earlier detours may be taken into works by Hildegard of Bingen, Guillaume de Machaut, Louis Couperin, and Jean-Philippe Rameau; extra-musical sources include Books of Hours, concrete poetry, and experimental theater.","professors":["Jane Alden"],"timesbyday":{"Tuesday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":11,"endmin":15,"location":"STOECK 211"}]}},{"subject":"MUSI","number":"698","section":"1","long_title":"Proseminar: Music Theory","description":"A survey of the major works, topics, questions, and techniques of research in the field of music theory as it has developed over the past half-century.

The Enlightenment arguably made “man’’ the measure of all things. Attempts to dismantle the world built by colonization and Enlightenment often involve decentering the human, especially as conceived in the white, Western, Christian imagination. Meanwhile, theologians continue to produce theological anthropologies and visions of how the human ought to act (ethics), in ways that often seem rather untroubled by concerns about the centrality of “man” (or Man, as Sylvia Wynter designates him). In this course, we examine some examples of theological anthropology and raise questions about whether and how it should be pursued.

In Russia, both political protest and political reaction are played out in overtly gendered terms (from Pussy Riot's punk prayer to Putin's bare-chested machismo). This upper-level seminar considers, from an ethnographic perspective, how gender has become a site of explicit politicization and contestation in post-Soviet societies. The first half of the course examines the changing circumstances of women and men in the post-Soviet economy following the Soviet collapse; the post-Soviet crises and reformulations of femininity and masculinity, and the social effects provoked thereby, such as violence, homophobia and new activism. The second half of the course examines the various 'intersections' of gender with other domains of social difference including class, age, race, religion, nationality. How gender is problematized in certain sites, workplaces, the home, and family is a topic of discussion, as is how certain ways of inhabiting gendered norms might give rise to forms of self and person, to modes of agency and freedom. Each post-Soviet case study is juxtaposed with comparative ethnographic examples in order to discern whether the post-Soviet region has its own gender dynamic, or instead partakes in broader global trends. These ethnographic cases are read alongside texts in feminist, gender, queer, and post-colonial theory to think across empirical examples in creative ways.","professors":["Dominic Martin"],"timesbyday":{"Tuesday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":11,"endmin":15,"location":"MY 601"}]}},{"subject":"RSEE","number":"379","section":"1","long_title":"Party Politics and the Media in Russia","description":"The course covers critical junctures in party and media systems development in Russia, discusses the choices made by elites and their consequences for shaping the party and media systems, and unpacks the strategic considerations behind these choices.

We analyze how each opera unfolds dramatically and musically—attending, on the one hand, to the libretto and its source in Russian literature; and on the other, to the expressive import and formal structure of the music.

The first part examines the road to World War I and the course of the war in the Middle Eastern theater’s principle fronts (Caucasus, Mesopotamia, Sinai/Syria, North Africa, Dardanelles). We then look at the period immediately following the October 1918 Mudros Armistice (that technically ended Allied/Ottoman hostilities). During this violent “Wilsonian Moment” in the Middle East, local aspirations for self-determination were articulated, reformulated, and argued locally and internationally while colonial actors—British, French, Italian, and Spanish—mobilized competing state-building projects. The last section of the course looks at the climax points of conflict between these competing projects in the mid to late 1920s—including the Great Syrian Revolt, the Rif War, Kurdish Revolts, Saudi wars of consolidation, and the Italo-Sanusi war in Libya—and how present-day political units were finally negotiated.

Part I focuses on fundamental concepts in sociology and the sociological analysis of law, covering topics such as class, culture, solidarity, legitimacy, bureaucracy, power, social control, and social capital. Part II provides a very brief introduction to sociological methods (qualitative and quantitative), with emphasis on learning to interpret and critique empirical research. Part III, the largest portion of the class, applies theory and methods to contemporary legal institutions and social problems. It covers a wide variety of topics, including understandings of law in everyday life, neighborhoods and residential segregation, race and racism, gender and sexuality, stigmatization and discrimination, diversity and affirmative action, poverty and the welfare state, housing law and housing inequality, family law and inequality, violence, policing, punishment, and immigration enforcement. In addition to a final exam or paper, students are expected to submit a small number of reading responses, participate in several small-group class discussions, and give one presentation during the latter half of the course.

Solo performance is at once an old and new art form: Homer sang the Odyssey by himself; Hamlet stands alone onstage questioning his own ontology and the nature of being in general. Priests, stand-up comedians, monologuists, TED-talkers: all solo artists. These instances demand of the actor the very specific and unusual kind of presentness that characterizes solo performance. And for the director of solo performance, the challenges are also very particular: how to establish the actor’s relationship to the audience, and how to direct the audience to the actor, be it as scene partner, as confidante, as eavesdropper, as a body of concerned witnesses. This course examines all dramatic modes of aloneness onstage, all the way through from the thinking-aloud of the soliloquy, the in-medias-res monologue, the stand-up comedy routine. Text analysis is followed by the study of acting techniques in best accordance with any given text. Students have the opportunity to perform classic monologues, as well as to explore modern performance texts and comedic performance. Students are also required to take on responsibilities for directing others in focusing and shaping solo work, and therefore thinking about the way aloneness on stage signifies, in ways that are both similar and very different to traditional, multicharacter scene work.","professors":["Deborah Margolin"],"timesbyday":{"Monday":[{"starthour":15,"startmin":30,"endhour":17,"endmin":20,"location":"YK220 101"}],"Wednesday":[{"starthour":15,"startmin":30,"endhour":17,"endmin":20,"location":"YK220 101"}]}},{"subject":"THST","number":"335","section":"1","long_title":"West African Dance: Traditional to Contemporary","description":"A practical and theoretical study of the traditional dances of Africa, focusing on those of Burkina Faso and their contemporary manifestations.

As critics have noted, there has been a renaissance regarding the work of James Baldwin since 1999, with scholarly publications devoted to his work, public tributes, films, and publications of previously uncollected or out of print works. Critics had hailed Baldwin’s earlier works—Go Tell It on the Mountain, Giovanni’s Room, Notes of a Native Son—as his greatest literary accomplishments. After Baldwin’s most celebrated work—The Fire Next Time—Baldwin appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1963, under the heading “Birmingham and Beyond: The Negro’s Push for Equality.” In this moment, Baldwin became a celebrated public figure in the U.S. and beyond. Our class investigates the period after this height of celebrity, when critics lambasted him for being too political, too angry, too bitter, and losing narrative control and rigor. This two-decade span is significant because Baldwin was witness to the deaths and incarceration of Civil Rights leaders (whom he mourned as friends), the increased surveillance and incarceration of black activists, the Vietnam war, the emergence of Black Power, feminist movements, and gay and queer liberations. During this time, Baldwin lived primarily in Turkey and France, and continued to travel globally. Baldwin’s essays, novels, speeches, and poetry wrestled with how to formally capture and witness the violences of imperialism, homophobia, and racism. Since his death, Baldwin’s work has continued to influence and inform theoretical insights in American studies, literary studies, Black studies, and queer studies. Our class engages with Baldwin’s formal practices, political contexts, and critical interpretations across these fields. ","professors":["Leah Mirakhor"],"timesbyday":{"Thursday":[{"starthour":13,"startmin":30,"endhour":15,"endmin":20,"location":"WLH 209"}]}},{"subject":"WGSS","number":"340","section":"1","long_title":"Feminist and Queer Theory","description":"Historical survey of feminist and queer theory from the Enlightenment to the present, with readings from key British, French, and American works.

A critical knowledge of Orientalism, colonialism, and global inequalities is crucial for a careful and nuanced understanding of the different roles gender and sexuality have played, and continue to play in representations of Islam, and Muslims.

How do we convey the realities of trauma and its aftermath without being exploitative? How do we write trauma without traumatizing the reader?

It is designed to allow graduate students to develop better fluency in psychoanalytic vernaculars, frameworks, and large-scale theories in order to gain a deeper and more nuanced appreciation of the persistence of psychoanalytic ways of thinking in the broader critical tradition in the humanities. Importantly, this is not a seminar dedicated solely to the psychoanalytic tradition; rather, it introduces students to seminal works by some of the major thinkers of early twentieth-century psychoanalytic thought in order to build a basis from which to understand the impact of psychoanalysis on the development of later twentieth-century critical movements, including woman-of-color feminist theory, queer theory, postcolonial studies, and black studies. In other words, the course provides a graduate-level introduction to the intellectual history and critical aftermath of psychoanalysis as a field of thought. It pays special attention to understanding psychoanalytic theories of the self, the subject, and the abject (among others), and putting these modes of conceptualizing the subject into conversation with both contemporaneous and later theories of subjectivity (materialist, Foucauldian, etc.). Readings include works by Freud, Klein, Winnicott, Lacan, Jean Laplanche, Frantz Fanon, Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Judith Butler, Kaja Silverman, Hortense Spillers, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Lee Edelman, Leo Bersani, Elizabeth Grosz, and others.

From Spinoza and Descartes to Hegel and Merleau-Ponty, we engage an overview of the conceptual and historical development of modern, Western ideas of personhood and the emergence of liberalism as the basis of new technologies of the self. We read these texts alongside feminist, critical race, and postcolonial commentaries that highlight the sexual and racial constitution of a seemingly universal subject of modernity. These commentaries trace how practical theories of “lower” or minor selves—the subject people of the colonies, slaves, and others—were integral to the very development of ideas of the modern, autonomous, and acting self in the Western world.","professors":["Eda Pepi"],"timesbyday":{"Wednesday":[{"starthour":13,"startmin":30,"endhour":15,"endmin":20,"location":"CO493 103"}]}},{"subject":"WGSS","number":"738","section":"1","long_title":"Gender and Politics after Socialism","description":"Gender is an intensely politicized fault line that runs through post-Soviet society. In Russia, both political protest and political reaction are played out in overtly gendered terms (from Pussy Riot’s punk prayer to Putin’s bare-chested machismo). This seminar considers, from an ethnographic perspective, how gender has become a site of explicit politicization and contestation in post-Soviet societies. The first half of the course examines the changing circumstances of women and men in the post-Soviet economy; the post-Soviet crises and reformulations of femininity and masculinity; and the social effects provoked thereby, such as violence, homophobia, and new activism. The second half examines the various intersections of gender with other domains of social difference including class, age, race, religion, nationality. How gender is problematized in certain sites, workplaces, the home, and family is a topic of discussion, as is how certain ways of inhabiting gendered norms might give rise to forms of self and person, to modes of agency and freedom. Each post-Soviet case study is juxtaposed with comparative ethnographic examples in order to discern whether the post-Soviet region has its own gender dynamic, or instead partakes in broader global trends. These ethnographic cases are read alongside texts in feminist, gender, queer, and postcolonial theory to think across empirical examples in creative ways.","professors":["Dominic Martin"],"timesbyday":{"Tuesday":[{"starthour":9,"startmin":25,"endhour":11,"endmin":15,"location":"MY 601"}]}},{"subject":"WGSS","number":"746","section":"1","long_title":"Visual Kinship: Families and Photographs","description":"Exploration of the history and practice of family photography from an interdisciplinary perspective.

Complemented by critical readings and seminar discussions about some of the trademarks of ethnographic research—e.g., participant observation, life history, field notes, and field sites—the course is designed to encourage students to interrogate the theoretical and methodological models that have been used in the production of knowledge about the Americas. Emphasizing ethnography’s concern with everyday life, practices, routines, and relationships, it analyzes how micro-processes and manifestations of race, sexuality, class, and gender entwine with macro-processes of empire and nation-state building, globalization, neoliberalism, transnationalism, urbanism, and social inequality in the United States, Latin America, and parts of the Caribbean. While this is not a “how to” course on ethnographic research, we use classic and contemporary ethnography to understand the region and gain greater knowledge about the process, epistemology, and politics of fieldwork. We analyze a number of aspects and approaches to doing and writing ethnography, including the challenges of entering, being in, and leaving the field; and as we build familiarity with the components of ethnography, we consider its applicability to an array of topics, settings, objects, cultural dynamics, and relationships. ","professors":["Ana Ramos-Zayas"],"timesbyday":{"Wednesday":[{"starthour":13,"startmin":30,"endhour":15,"endmin":20,"location":"WLH 004"}]}},{"subject":"WLOF","number":"120","section":"1","long_title":"Elementary Wolof II","description":"Continuation of WLOF 110.
